 FakeSMTP uses {{{http://code.google.com/p/subethasmtp/}SubEtha SMTP}}: an easy-to-use server-side SMTP library for Java.\
FakeSMTP is free to use for commercial and non-commercial projects and the source code is provided.\
It is licensed under the very free BSD or GPL license, whichever you prefer.


* Requirements

 You need Java JVM 1.6 or newer installed on your machine.\
If you are on a "Unix-like" machine (Mac, GNU/Linux, BSD...), you may have to be "root" to start the port 25, otherwise, try another port >= 1024.


* Usage

 The fakeSMTP.jar is auto-executable.\
If your desktop environment supports it, you can directly double click on the .jar file.\
Otherwise, run the following command:

+--
 java -jar fakeSMTP.jar
+--


* Alternatives

 FakeSMTP was created because we couldn't find any free (as in freedom) and cross-platform SMTP server with GUI for testing emails in applications or websites.\
